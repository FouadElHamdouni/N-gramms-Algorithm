United Nations, far contributed, required fundamental provisions Charter, consolidation international peace security liberation struggle peoples, contrary, diktat imperialist powers, United States America foremost among them, embarked path diametrically opposed principles, served instrument favoring policy pillage, oppression aggression peace-loving peoples countries. 35. utilization United Nations serve policy resulted Organization able stay hand committing aggression many parts world, frequently helped aggressors, activity direction going far, moreover, flag United Nations perpetrated barbarous aggressions experienced since end Second World War, as, among others, armed aggressions Korea Congo. 36. whole progressive mankind recalls admiration heroic struggle which, direction great Stalin, Soviet Union waged, cooperation AngloAmerican coalition, defend peaceful peoples countries Hitlerite Germany. historic decisive victories Red Army Nazi hordes great role played Soviet Union Second World War aroused great enthusiasm among peoples awakened hope better future. followed great interest particular joy unflinching struggle waged Leninist Soviet Union world arena, well authentic representatives Organization, order defend vital interests sustain legitimate struggle liberation imperialist, colonialist racist yoke. following usurpation power country Khrushchev clique, situation changed completely, struggle Soviet Union American imperialism allies replaced holy alliance Soviet Union United States peace-loving freedom-loving peoples countries. thus that, far United Nations concerned, become center bargaining, maneuvering underhand manipulations part American imperialists Soviet social-imperialists, designed lull vigilance peoples disguise best can policy world hegemony. 37. well known consequences United Nations, particularly damaging authority ability play part incumbent upon Charter. But, time, negative activity helped peoples realize better nature two imperialist Powers can expected United Nations present circumstances manipulated two Powers. has, particular, become obvious initiatives proposals American governing circles Moscow revisionists connexion disarmament agreements seek impose States field, respect conventional armaments nuclear armaments, designed solely disarm peace-loving countries ensure nuclear monopoly largest possible quantity armaments sorts order subjugate peoples enslave world wish divide them. Peoples becoming aware ever way break free every imperialist, colonialist racist yoke armed struggle trust strength, time enjoying solidarity support freedom-loving peoples countries. 38. One undeniable proofs United Nations embarked road violating principles spirit Charter withholding 21 years legitimate rights People's Republic China Organization, circumstance brought abnormal situation without precedent Organization constituted severe blow prestige, also time affected capacity regarding contribution make settlement important problems time, none which, well know, can given real solution without participation great socialist China 700 million people. 39. Undoubtedly, state affairs Organization discourage Member States espouse fundamental principles Charter. contrary, trusting strength possibilities encouraged development victories liberation struggle waged peoples continents, will redouble efforts cooperate closely order wage effective battle policy diktat force practiced two great imperialist Powers United Nations elsewhere world. 40. liberation movement world level imperialist colonialist Powers present making new strides. peoples reacted policy oppression domination practiced imperialist Powers aggressions plots, strengthening just struggle independence freedom joining ranks armed struggle aggressors. shown struggle heroic peoples VietNam, Laos, Cambodia countries Indo-China, straggle people Korea peoples Far East United States imperialists, allies tools, struggle valiant Palestinians Arab peoples imperialistZionist aggression, struggle peoples Oman Dhofar peoples Arabian Gulf free colonial yoke, resistance peoples Eastern Europe domination new imperialists Kremlin, struggle African peoples Mozambique, Angola, Guinea (Bissau), Namibia, Southern Rhodesia South Africa colonial Powers, settlers racist tools, struggle people Puerto Rico free imperialist yoke United States, well struggles waged peoples various parts world, including American people citadel imperialism. imperialist Powers allies suffering defeat defeat. Powerful blows struck everywhere peoples struggling national independence, freedom sacred inalienable right masters destiny. 41. Panic-stricken impetuous growth revolutionary struggle liberation peoples assailed multiple internal external difficulties, two so-called superPowers, American imperialism Soviet social-imperialism, head reactionary forces, striving means power face desperate situation accelerate implementation aggressive warlike plans peace-loving peoples countries. two Powers period intensified collusion criminal activities, using deceit demagogy well various forms pressure, force armed aggression. 42. Although split numerous contradictions deriving imperialist nature, trying undermine evict political, economic strategic positions, two superPowers common hatred freedom peoples socialist revolution. basis rest cooperation aggressive activities, plans plots, extend continents conformity global counterrevolutionary strategy, designed divide dominate world. Glasborough policy pursued uninterruptedly, AmericanSoviet collusion taken fresh steps forward. guise peaceful slogans 'peaceful settlement' conflicts brought precisely aggressions perpetrated directed, European, Asian international 'security' fact nothing security imperialist order disarmament, 'internationalism' presupposes 'limited sovereignty', exactly subjugation peoples nations, well slogans, plot coordinate positions activities regarding various problems affect interests mankind whole. Using slogans, hatching plans trying impose so-called peaceful settlements means trying repress liberation struggle waged peoples; concluding treaties fraudulent enslaving trying conclude new aggressive pacts will added pacts, blocs military bases now existence; exerting pressure sorts freedom-loving peoples countries dare resist them; carrying arms race preparations new war; indulge nuclear blackmail fresh acts aggression. 43. connexion can cite, simultaneously secret negotiations two Powers diplomatic channels, long meetings representatives Helsinki later Vienna, meetings certainly limited question 'limitation strategic arms', socalled Rogers plan 'peaceful settlement' Middle East problem, plan result American Soviet plot designed stifle legitimate liberation struggle Palestinian people Arab peoples, origin bloody events taken place recently Jordan. similar nature negotiations United States Soviet Union Indo-China meetings organized Moscow elsewhere representatives reactionary regimes Asia bring 'peaceful settlement' problem settlement believe will lead capitulation peoples VietNam, Laos Cambodia travels high emissaries two Powers Asia efforts create new aggressive pacts accordance Brezhnev plan 'collective security Asia' Nixon plan pit Asiatics Asiatics, plans concerted two Powers designed first foremost create circle fire around People's Republic China. category mention enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty well MoscowBonn treaty, among things tramples foot sovereign rights German people Democratic Republic Germany which, together SovietAmerican project so-called European security, relates spheres influence two Powers Europe rearguard activities continent order implement counterrevolutionary plans Asia, Africa elsewhere. 44. order bring great anti-popular conspiracy, American Soviet imperialists applying series political, economic military measures, intensifying imperialist American aggression Laos new aggression Cambodia, plots wiles designed divide Arab peoples countries plunge bloody fratricidal conflict repress means possible, including armed force, legitimate struggle heroic people Palestine. similar nature also threats measures taken Soviet revisionists peoples Eastern European countries, including military maneuvers Soviet occupation forces Czechoslovakia, carried last August intimidate people eve second anniversary Soviet invasion Czechoslovakia. 45. Thus two Powers stop nothing realize imperialist plans stifle revolutionary struggle peace-loving peoples countries, establish domination world arrogate role international police order decide good time fate humanity. 46. However, castles air. wheel history turned backwards. era fate peoples small countries decided great imperialist Powers gone ever. imperialists intensify aggressive activities, peoples strengthen struggle peoples strengthen struggle closely become united vast front armed struggle common enemy. Never will peoples renounce legitimate struggle win back vital rights. Despite temporary vicissitudes, struggle whole increasing strengthened appears now 'ever storm liberation breaking throughout Asia, Africa elsewhere, storm will completely annihilate, spite underhanded maneuvers repressions, imperialist colonialist domination whatever form may exist. 47. recent example best illustration awaits American imperialists policy intervention war armed aggression perpetrated Cambodia last March, immediately coup d'etat plotted country. Faced impasse blows meted struggle VietNamese people, American aggressors sent troops Cambodia order implement 'Nixon doctrine', designed pit IndoChinese IndoChinese. aggression, far leading expected results, immediately met armed resistance people Cambodia military solidarity VietNamese Laotian brothers, powerfully supported great Chinese people well peoples Asia. aroused energetic opposition part peoples throughout world, including American people. Instead stifling liberation struggle VietNamese people, aggression Cambodia spread throughout Indo-China fire liberation revolutionary struggle opened even wider deeper abyss, American imperialism will finally engulfed without hope rescued. 48. success gained Cambodian people, leadership United Front Cambodia, presided Head State, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, liberating large part national territory aggressors lackeys, solidarity new consolidation unity peoples Cambodia, VietNam, Laos, People's Republic China, Democratic People's Republic Korea, well revolutionary peoples Asia, constitute harsh blow American imperialism, collaborators lackeys. 49. American aggression Cambodia time proof collusion, expense people, American imperialism revisionists Moscow, latter adopted occasion attitude similar American Government towards aggression Czechoslovakia. particular, refusal recognize Government United Front Cambodia fact maintain normal diplomatic relations Lon Nol clique, instrument American imperialism supported puppets Saigon Seoul even riffraff Chiang Kaishek, well international reaction whole, revealed world public opinion true way camp imperialism reaction. 50. events current year Cambodia throughout Indo-China great importance IndoChinese peoples, now fresh proof obstinacy American imperialism carrying acts aggression extending war, also now better position decide sincerely Yankee invader him, Soviet social-imperialists great socialist China represents them. Thus realize armed struggle way become free American aggressors. 51. Despite intensification efforts American imperialists, backed Soviet revisionists, valiant people VietNam thwarted plans dangerous subterfuges designed bring capitulation. Throughout South VietNam people popular liberation army taken arms struck crushing blows American aggressors, without giving moment respite even military camps bases, Da Nang, Ben Tre, Hue, outskirts Saigon parts country. VietNamese people armed forces have, brilliant victories, tied American imperialists Saigon tools battlefield. victories shown undeniably efforts Yankee aggressors escape inevitable defeat extending war brought irreparable reversals. long revolutionary struggle tempered VietNamese people made invincible, determined heroic struggle will undoubtedly deal ever crushing blows American imperialism completely defeated. 52. armed struggle national wellbeing peoples^ VietNam, Laos Cambodia constantly developing reinforced; now new stage. criminal plots American Soviet imperialists hatched order bring so-called peaceful settlement Indo-China doomed complete failure. American imperialism surrounded defeated fronts. bound beaten. 53. typical case shows ferocity great AmericanSoviet conspiracy method combining diverse means action part imperialist Powers order carry policy aggression hegemony tragic serious situation prevails present time Near East. Concerned implementing costs common plan sad repute baptized Rogers plan designed liquidate Palestinian question divide Arab peoples, legalize reward imperialistIsraeli aggression assure imperialist interests area, United States revisionist Soviet Union plotted put effect criminal collusion designed stifle Palestinian liberation movement reactionary regime Jordan, thus trying implement Near East Nixon doctrine aimed pitting Asians Asians. Thus Jordanian reaction, serving American imperialism Zionism, used fire sword, cannons, tanks aviation heroic Palestinian fighters. Barbarous mass massacres perpetrated Palestinian population Amman elsewhere. time, American imperialism, statements Nixon, Laird leaders, threatens intervene internal affairs Arab countries also threatens intervention Sixth Fleet, thus trying, always, play role international policeman oppress peoples suppress liberation struggles, defend cliques pockets, defend rapacious interests enslave peoples. 54. American imperialism world reaction consider unfair fraternal assistance given Syria Iraq Arab brothers struggling just cause, common cause. According logic right freedom intervene countries, everywhere; can utilize tanks, cannons, war fleets oppress exploit peoples countries, whereas Syria Iraq entitled come aid brothers. 55. wave indignation resentment unleashed throughout progressive world. Quite rightly, conscience Arab peoples revolted treachery ruling clique Jordan. world wonders: tanks bullets used Palestinians? struggling liberty, independence sacred land? 56. peoples continents, profoundly indignant, raising voices protest American imperialists Soviet socio imperialists; crying: 'Hands Palestinian people, Jordan, Syria Arab countries.' 57. quite clear Palestinians obeying 'Rogers plan'. know full well American plan based Security Council resolution 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] which, know, result bargaining corridors Americans Soviets designed, inter alia, impose elimination Palestinian question recognition Israel's right annex part territories invaded following aggression 5 June 1967. plan also designed reward Zionist aggression guaranteeing existence State Israel, taken Arab territories also conquered aggression, also recognizing rights. Still worse, two 'superPowers' want use new ceasefire continue maneuvers machinations engaged past three years order apply tactics used imperialist powers Israeli aggression 1948, aim putting ever fulfillment sacred cause Arabs thus making fait accompli Israel's new occupation territories. 58. No, Arab people will never accept United StatesSoviet diktat, designed bring recapitulation. Palestinian people Arab peoples rejected plot. efforts United States imperialists Soviet revisionists vain. Arab peoples long experience, well know Israeli aggressors masters. Never will allow two foreign Powers decide fate, whatever machinations sharing roles, one presenting author criminal plan giving plan support. 59. Arab peoples know full well proposal United States America, incited assisted Israel unleash aggression three years ago continues provide Israel armaments encourages pursue aggression provocation, designed simply serve imperialist interests Power area Near East, great strategic importance rich petroleum deposits, well interests Israel, instrument. obvious one deny without assistance support United States Israel never position initiate aggression June 1967, even less continue occupy Arab territories. 60. regard Soviet revisionists, whatever mask may put on, Arab peoples know faces, especially since AmericanIsraeli aggression, convinced interested penetrating Near East Mediterranean Basin creating conditions favorable expansion area. 61. leader Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, referring problem statement 18 September electors Tirana, said, among things: 'In final analysis, glorious revolutionary Arab peoples will wool pulled eyes false friendship Soviet social imperialism, taken advantage temporary difficulties occupy ports seas stifle just liberation struggle Fascist Zionists United States imperialists. two aggressive imperialist Powers interested planting roots deep Near East ensuring economic, political military bases countries area; want oppress peoples countries, lulling words, demoralizing corrupting order, finally, use bases, go even invade Africa, Asia regions, starting colonial wars plundering various continents. 'The Albanian people love Arab peoples, brothers friends good times bad. time revolutionary liberation struggles, side constantly; supported will continue support means disposal. confidence triumph just cause fighting. But, order win early victory common enemy, unity hard steel must forged among Arab peoples armed struggle. Zionists, United States imperialists Soviet revisionists seeking divide Arab peoples, disarm them, impose peace will enemies'. arms supplied controlled Soviets. made available sacred Arab cause, used precisely deceive Arabs, tie hands send slaughterhouse. 'Rogers plan' ill repute accurately called 'RogersGromyko plan'. Arab peoples will certainly never fall terrible trap plan. SovietUnited States armies can, recourse various insidious means, succeed establishing sides Suez Canal, case one may wonder purpose hardware supplied Arabs Soviets serve. heroically driven one imperialist Canal see occupied now two others. 'The clamoring Day harmony secret maneuvers Soviet revisionists, crackling heroic guns Arab Palestinian brothers glorious reply, will put great conspiracy enemies. Therefore, possible means, must resolutely assist partisan struggle Palestinians, struggle now forefront general battle must waged Arab peoples fronts. Arab brothers will succeed raising high banner liberation struggle imperialists Zionists. will reduce nothing plans Soviet revisionists provocations organized agencies CIA conspiring liberation struggle people Palestine Arab peoples.' 62. Arab peoples great revolutionary traditions known bravery liberation struggles. know fighting Israeli aggressors only, also two imperialist Powers mainly responsible situation Near East and, therefore, will allow fall traps Powers. 63. events recent days Jordan confirmed that, leader Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, indicated statement 18 September, Soviet social-imperialism pursuing aims nothing common interests Arab peoples. occasions, concerned fate Arab peoples; sole aim consolidate imperialist positions. particular case, Soviet revisionist leaders, replying Nixon's appeal bring Moscow's fire brigade snuff revolutionary struggle Palestinians Arab peoples, subjugate enslave them, hastened assume role firemen. official declarations propaganda organs, came defense clique power Jordan, threatening Palestinians slogan 'Violence leads violence', addressing appeals Arab peoples asking give struggle. facts served make even obvious Arab peoples perfidious role played social imperialists Moscow real aims United StatesSoviet plan Near East. 64. Palestinians consider Jordan second homeland. cause disruption Jordan; rather, fault lies reactionary regime Jordan King Hussein, service United States imperialism 'Rogers plan'. contrary, Palestinians Jordan healthiest element common struggle annihilate common enemy. 65. Albanian people profoundly indignant, strongly condemns criminal acts supports heroic struggle Palestinians fighting sacred rights. convinced that, thanks resolute struggle strengthening unity combat, enjoying support true friends, freedom-loving peoples, will expose plots enemies gain final victory aggressors. 66. dealings United States Soviet Union, important place held also so-called question European security conference, proposed last year Kremlin leaders instrument aggression, Warsaw Treaty. signs intense activity year, instigation two Powers. accordance strategy consolidate subsequently extend domination Europe carrying aggressive plans areas, United States Soviet imperialists particularly concerned ensuring success project. Soviet revisionists particular showing special haste, can explained internal difficulties, ever growing resistance countries Eastern Europe policy intervention domination, plans preparations aggression directed towards Asia People's Republic China. course United States West em allies, particularly Federal Republic Germany, failed everything power exploit haste displayed Soviet revisionist leadership, order obtain largest possible number concessions German problem West Berlin, well ensure economic, political cultural penetration countries Eastern Europe. 67. Confronted insurmountable difficulties relating contradictions existing many problems United States imperialists Soviet social imperialists well European States, two called superPowers, order find way mislead public opinion, hit following formula serve guiding principle agreement concluded framework: 'renunciation use force relations among States Europe'. misleading formula designed fact give something cling conclude agreements. basis formula negotiations took place Federal Republic Germany German Democratic Republic Poland, well long negotiations, paramount importance, Soviet Union West Germany. 68. activities step greatest impact SovietWest German Treaty signed 12 August last Moscow. Intense propaganda attended signing Treaty designed present historic event said bring peace Europe integrity borders. course, campaign, regardless means used, deceive naive. peoples Europe, great experience, taken empty rhetoric. particular, propaganda statements Soviet American leaders, supporters, fail recall vast deceitful campaigns accompanied various stages plotting compromises Western Powers Hitlerian militarism, especially regards Munich Agreement September 1938. 69. Moscow Treaty fact solution German problem. Indeed open violation decisions problem adopted Allied Powers war, oft renewed promises Soviet revisionist leadership conclude peace treaty two German States, simply German Democratic Republic, defend interests sovereign rights latter. Soviet revisionists trampled foot commitments obligations, thus committed serious crime German people, German Democratic Republic, peace security Europe entire world. therefore assumed heavy responsibility. 70. Moscow Treaty fact formal recognition entry conquered Germany community States, without signed peace treaty. SovietGerman Treaty, apart equivocal questionable terms, reference recognition borders two German States OderNeisse line dividing Poland German Democratic Republic final unchangeable borders; recognition Federal Republic Germany German Democratic Republic independent, sovereign State fully enjoying international rights. Even important, Chancellor West Germany leaders Bonn stated one occasion, signing Treaty, will never give idea reunification German nation, means annexation German Democratic Republic. position confirmed documents annexed Treaty. Bonn Government thus endeavoring make situation gain time order prepare attain its; expansionist objectives favorable circumstances. Thus, Soviet revisionists considered used German Democratic Republic bargaining counter dealings revengeseekers Bonn, still claim right speak act behalf Germany, supported great Western Powers. 71. provisions Treaty concerning renunciation use force inviolability borders, mean borders fact unchangeable, people Europe know full well value commitments part German revenge-seekers, memory Hitler's nonaggression pacts European States still fresh minds. 72. Therefore, points view, Moscow Treaty undeniably provides Bonn's leaders something fall back on. encourages expansionist revenge-seeking plans time serious blow German Democratic Republic progressive peace-loving forces Germany. 73. one can deny 'He creation German Democratic Republic great victory German people peoples Europe, closely connected peace security Europe. strengthening German Democratic Republic recognition States Europe, basis principle sovereign equality, interest security, essential condition settlement German problem sound basis sincere attempt place German people road peace democracy, cooperation, friendship European peoples. agreement Soviet Union West Germany dangerous step opposite direction. fail condemned ,by peace freedom-loving countries peoples Europe. 74. obvious Moscow Treaty first foremost result bargaining United States Soviet imperialists, within framework plans global strategy Europe continents. Treaty time agreement two new imperialist Powers, Soviet social imperialism West German militarism, and, such, serious threat European continent also areas world object United StatesSoviet plans aggression. Thus leaders Moscow joined successive Governments Washington raising West Germany level main shock force, principal partner two Powers putting effect counterrevolutionary plans plans subjugate freedom-loving peoples countries. can fail occasion remind Assembly similar plans part policy Western Powers toward Hitler's Germany; proved costly them, Hitler's Germany eventually turned them. 75. MoscowBonn Treaty undeniably new link series plots Soviets Americans world's peoples, serious threat entailed escape attention Government sincerely concerned vital interests people, national security independence world peace. 76. Albanian Government always sympathy justified concern European States sincerely interested security peace Europe search appropriate ways means normalize situation continent, deliver hegemony two major imperialist Powers reject idea spheres influence, eliminate two aggressive blocs dominated them, create favorable circumstances development European cooperation basis respect independence national sovereignty, sovereign equality mutual benefit. fully line principles underlying foreign policy. But, States know full well, noble objectives nothing common criminal plans United States Soviet imperialists supporters. activities, pacts propose conclude, initiatives proposals, including 'European security', 'collective security Asia', 'international security' presented again, initiative Soviet revisionists, present session General Assembly two Powers constantly motivated insatiable greed dominate exploit peoples world, desire maintain consolidate spheres influence Europe elsewhere free hand areas, ensure tranquility rear better carry various expansionist plans Asia, Africa elsewhere, using whatever means necessary, even extent threatening using armed force. 77. really need prove true state affairs. amply borne international realities hotbeds imperialist war many areas world aggression Indo-China, Middle East, Far East, Europe elsewhere; military bases United States Soviet imperialists Europe continents; occupation foreign territories; nuclear blackmail; arms race; fleets warships v/hich cruise Mediterranean, Pacific seas oceans threaten peace-loving peoples countries areas. borne out, inter alia, criminal plans Europe, particular role assigned revenge-seeking Germany, plans Asia aimed particularly encirclement People's Republic China preparation war country cooperation aggressive Powers, particular Japanese militarism. can one claim guarantee peace Europe conditions aegis protection two imperialist Powers, American Soviet? 78. One wonders peace guaranteed. threatening peace security peoples Europe? Can us small, peace-loving countries? opinion, caught SovietAmerican traps 'European security' 'collective security Asia' tantamount serving aggressive plans or, rather, throwing oneself wolves. Today ever peace indivisible, peace Europe war Asia elsewhere. 79. Comrade Enver Hoxha, statement occasion twenty-fifth anniversary liberation Albania, stated connexion: 'First, question assured whom.
